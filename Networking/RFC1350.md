# TFTP Specification
## Protocol
- Simple protocol for transferring files
- Each packet is acknowledged individually 
- Designed to be small and easy to implement
- Partially inspired by EFTP

## General information
- Originally implemented on top of the UTP, but can be implemented 
  on top of other datagram protocols (like Reliable Datagram Protocol)
- Lacks most of the features of the FTP or SFTP
- Only capable of reading and writing from/to remote server
  - Can't list directories
  - Can't authenticate remote hosts
- Uses 8-bit wide bytes

## Modes
- `netascii` - 8-bit ascii, i.e text files
- `octet` - Raw 8-bit bytes
- `mail` - Designated as obsolete and not needed for implementation
- Hosts can define their own modes

## Protocol overview
- A transfer begins with a R/W request, that also initiates the connection
- If server grants the request, the connection is opened and file is sent
  in fixed length blocks of 512 bytes
- Each packet must be ACKownledged
- If the packet contains less than 512 bytes, it's the terminal packet
- If the packet got lost, retransmission of the last packet occurs
- On error, the connection is terminated and error packet is sent

## Errors
- Unable to satisfy the request (file permissions, no such file etc.)
- Incorrectly formatted packet
- Losing access to a necessary resource

## ISO/OSI
- Packets will have an IP header, UDP header and a TFTP header
- TFTP header consists of a 2 byte opcode field, which indicates the packet's type

## Initiating a connection
- First, a request (WRQ or RRQ) is sent and first ACK/data packet is received
  - The data packet has a block number that starts at 1
  - The ACK packet also has a block number that starts 0 on request to write
- If the reply is an error packet, then the request has been denied
- The initial request must go on the port 69 (nice)
  - Then, the server chooses its own unique port, probably above 1024 port range

## Data exchange
- After establishing a connection, the packets pairs data-ACK are sent
  to chosen ports
- If hosts receive a packet with incorrect TID, the packet should be discarded
  and an error packet should be sent to the source of incorrect packet
  without transfer termination

## Acknowledgment
- All packets are acknowledged by the ACK packet
  - Exceptions: duplicate ACK packets and those used for termination
- DATA packet is an acknowledgment for the first ACK packet of the previous DATA packet
- WRQ and DATA packets are acknowledged by ACK or ERROR
- RRQ and ACK packets are acknowledged by DATA or ERROR packets

## Termination
### Normal
- If the last packet contains less than 512 bytes of data, 
  then it's the terminating packet
- Termination occurs by the transmission of the final ACK packet
  - The server must wait - if it receives the last packet again,
    it means that client timed out and ACK packet was lost

### Premature
- If request cannot be granted or some error occurred, an ERROR packet is sent,
  effectively terminating the session

## Packets
- TFTP has 5 types of packets

### WRQ/RRQ
```
 2 bytes   String     nullchar     String    nullchar
+--------+----------+----------+-----------+----------+
| Opcode | Filename |   '\0'   |    Mode   |   '\0'   |
+--------+----------+----------+-----------+----------+
```

- Opcode 
  - For RRQ - 1
  - For WRQ - 2
- Filename
  - null-terminated ASCII string representing filename
- Mode
  - `netascii` - Host must translate it to its own format
  - `octet` - After resending should be identical to the original
  - `mail` - In the form of `username` or `username@hostname`
  - All of the modes can be spelled in mixed case, i.e. `NeTASCiI` is valid
  - Custom modes can be specified

### DATA
```
  2 bytes   2 bytes   n bytes
+---------+---------+---------+
| Opcode  | Block # | Data    |
+---------+---------+---------+
```

- Opcode
  - Always 3
- Block
  - Block number in range(1, 65536)
- Data
  - From 0 to 512 bytes
  - If the block size is 512 bytes, then there are more blocks to come
  - Else, the current block is the last one

### ACK
```
  2 bytes   2 bytes
+---------+---------+
| Opcode  | Block # |
+---------+---------+
```

- Opcode
  - Always 4
- Block
  - The block number of the packet being acknowledged
  - WRQ is acknowledged with the ACK packet with block number of 0

### ERROR
```
  2 bytes   2 bytes   String   nullchar
+---------+---------+--------+----------+
| Opcode  |    EC   | ErrMsg |   '\0'   |
+---------+---------+--------+----------+
```

- Opcode
  - Always 5
- EC
  - 0 - Not defined, see ErrMSG
  - 1 - File not found
  - 2 - Access violation
  - 3 - Disk full or allocation exceeded
  - 4 - Illegal TFTP operation
  - 5 - Unknown transfer ID
  - 6 - File already exists
  - 7 - No such user
- ErrMsg
  - Human-readable error message in the form of null-terminated string
